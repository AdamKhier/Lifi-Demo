## Introduction
Welcome to my LiFi Technology Demo project! This project demonstrates data transfer using LiFi (Light Fidelity), a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. This demo showcases how data can be sent and received using an LED and a light sensor.


## Project Overview
This demonstration works by placing two Arduinos on a breadboard, each with a light sensor and an LED. When the program runs, the Arduino converts text into binary and transfers it to the LED. If the LED is off, it represents *`0`*, and if on, it represents *`1`*. The sensor then reads this signal, translates the binary back into text, and displays it.
