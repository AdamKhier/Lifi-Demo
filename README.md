# LiFi Technology Demo

## Introduction
Welcome to my LiFi Technology Demo project! This project demonstrates data transfer using LiFi (Light Fidelity). LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. This demo will showcase how data can be sent and received using an LED and a light sensor.

## Project Overview
This demonstration will work by placing 2 arduinos on a breadboard with a light sensor and an LED. When the program is run the arduino will convert text into binary and transfer it to the LED. If the LED is off it is equal to 0 and if on then 1. The sensor then reads this translating the binary back to normal text and displaying it.

## Setup
### Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino nano
- IR LED x2
- IR sensor x2
- Bread board x2
- small diplay for Arduino
### Software Requirements
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- Java Script
- C++ (Arduino)

## Project Previous State
So far, the project is very successful with the addition of visuallising how it works along with live translations in the html files. The lined one will show live translation (while being slow for people to see), whereas the singularly blocked on will provie the end resault of fast data transfer. However this project has not reached any hardware further than getting the code to run on a Raspberry Pi. I have yet to include the sensors and LED in the code.

## Project Current State
I mapped the hardware to pins on the Aruino and started coding.

## Future Plans
I would fix code and add acknowlegement feature to make sure text is correct.
